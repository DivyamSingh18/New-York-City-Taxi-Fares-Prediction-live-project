# NYC-Taxi-Fares-Prediction

* In this Project Haversine distance formula is used:<br>
=> sklearn.metrics.pairwise.haversine_distances(X, Y=None)

The Haversine (or great circle) distance is the angular distance between two points on the surface of a sphere. The first coordinate of each point is assumed to be the latitude, the second is the longitude, given in radians. The dimension of the data must be 2.
